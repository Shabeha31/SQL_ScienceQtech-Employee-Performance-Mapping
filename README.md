## Project Description
This project focuses on developing and analyzing an employee performance database for ScienceQtech. With the annual appraisal cycle approaching, the HR department required a structured database solution to evaluate employee performance, analyze salary distribution, assess departmental efficiency, and identify training or budget requirements. As a Junior Database Administrator, the objective was to build a comprehensive SQL-based data model and generate analytical insights to support HR decision-making.

The project begins with the creation of an Employee Database, importing datasets for employees (emp_record_table), data science team members (data_science_team), and project details (proj_table). Using SQL queries, the project explores employee demographics, roles, and departmental performance through filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations. Queries are designed to identify top performers, calculate bonuses using salary and performance ratings, and analyze salary distributions across countries and continents. Advanced SQL features such as joins, nested subqueries, window functions, and ranking operations are implemented to extract meaningful insights.

Additionally, stored procedures and user-defined functions are developed to automate repetitive HR queries, such as retrieving employee details by experience and validating job roles against organizational standards. Performance optimization is achieved through index creation and execution plan analysis, ensuring efficient query execution. The project concludes with the generation of views and role-based data insights for reporting purposes.

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in real-world business analytics, enabling data-driven decisions for employee evaluation, resource planning, and organizational improvement while showcasing strong database design, querying, and optimization skills.
